# VSCode config

Just somewhere to save my personal settings for VSCode. I'm not really sure
what the correct method is for keeping things in sync, and it doesn't seem
anywhere near as configurable as
[`~/.emacs.d/`](https://github.com/davep/.emacs.d).

For now I have the `settings.json` file in:

```
~/Library/ApplicationSupport/Code/User
```

(on my iMac) symlinked to:

```
~/.vscode.d/settings.json
```

and I sync all changes to that up to this repo.
